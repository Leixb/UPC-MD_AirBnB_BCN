\section{Data source}%
\label{sec:data_source}

The \airbnb data for Barcelona listings that we use in this project comes from a
publicly accessible data set linked in the bibliography~\cite{dataset} created
by Inside AirBnb\footnote{Inside Airbnb: \url{http://insideairbnb.com/} (Not
affiliated with \airbnb)}, which aims to present \airbnb data for most major
cities all around the globe in order to provide valuable insight into how
\airbnb is being used in each one of them.  It extracts this data directly from
\airbnb's website and the version of the data set we are working with is a
snapshot of all Barcelona listings that were available on August 24\ts{th} 2020.
