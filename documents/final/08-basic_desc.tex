\fign{accommodates}{Accommodates}

In the boxplot we can that there are some outliers. However the distribution of the variable seems to be in line with socioeconomic distributions. The majority of listing have low to medium capacities (small-medium houses), while there's only a fraction of high capacities (big houses). 


\fign{bedrooms}{bedrooms}

The majority of listing contains between 1-4 bedrooms, being the mean around 1.6. There are
some outliers, but they can somewhat be explained due to the same reasons mentioned in the accommodates analysis.


\fign{beds}{beds}

The distribution of beds and the outliers seem to follow a similar distribution as bedrooms.
This is to be expected as those to variables should be correlated. 


\fign{availability_30}{availability 30}

If we look at the availability in the next 30 days after the data was taken, 
we can clearly see some polarization. There are some rentals with 0 available days and some close to all days. This polarization explains the high variance
of this variable.


%\fign{availability_60}{availability 60}
%\fign{availability_90}{availability 90}
\fign{availability_365}{availability 365}

The availability of the year follows a similar distribution to the monthly one.
The only difference are some peaks at 90 days and half a year, which both are 
likely numbers for a host to rent it's listing.

\figf{host_acceptance_rate_cat}{host acceptance rate cat}

Up to 66\% of the hosts have a very high chance of accepting a customer.

In figure \ref{fig:host_since_year-pie} we can see that except for the first years the among of new hosts has more or less remained constant. However 
in 2019 there has been another spike of new hosts.

\figf{neighbourhood_group_cleansed}{neighbourhood group cleansed}

Looking at \ref{fig:neighbourhood_group_cleansed-pie} we can see that L'Eixample
and Ciutat Vella are the most popular neighborhoods for listing.

\fign{price}{price}
\fig{price-hi_bp-tallat500}{price}

In the figure \ref{fig:price-hi_bp-tallat500} we can see that there are some extreme outliers. To visualize the distribution better we have cut the histogram at price 500. Having done that we can see that the price distribution seems to follow a chi-square. We were surprised to find out that the mean price is 
around \$86.34.

\fign{review_scores_location}{review scores location}

The location score seems to be the one with most positive reviews. In fact the mean is 9.61, almost 0.5 higher than the overall rating. We found as well
very few negative reviews, being in fact the median and Q3 both a 10.


\fign{review_scores_rating}{review scores rating}

We can see that the majority of reviews are considered positive. The mean in fact is 
a 91.07. That would explain why a common technique among renters is to consider 
any review lower than 90 as negative. 

We can see as well that there is some polarization, being the most common rating among 
negative reviews a 0 and the most common among positive a 10. We suppose polarization occurs
because users are more likely to leave reviews when they had either really good or 
really bad experiences.

\fign{reviews_per_month}{reviews per month}

When looking at \ref{fig:reviews_per_month} we can clearly see a decreasing curve with its mean around 1.17. We found some outliers with the max number of reviews per month being 21. Despite it being quite larger than the mean we think it is still plausible to have 21 reviews over a 30 day span.

\figf{room_type}{room type}

The vast majority of listings correspond to entire homes/apartments or private rooms.
