\fign{accommodates}{Histogram + Boxplot of Accommodates}

In the boxplot we can that there are some outliers. However the distribution of the variable seems to be in line with socioeconomic distributions. The majority of listing have low to medium capacities (small-medium houses), while there's only a fraction of high capacities (big houses). 


\fign{bedrooms}{Histogram + Boxplot of bedrooms}

The majority of listing contains between 1-4 bedrooms, being the mean around 1.6. There are
some outliers, but they can somewhat be explained due to the same reasons mentioned in the accommodates analysis.


\fign{beds}{Histogram + Boxplot of beds}

The distribution of beds and the outliers seem to follow a similar distribution as bedrooms.
This is to be expected as those to variables should be correlated.

We can see that the majority of reviews are considered positive. We can aswell see that there is some polaritzation, being the most common rating among negative reviews a 0 and the most common among positi
The mean in fact is a 91.07.
