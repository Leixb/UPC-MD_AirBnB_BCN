\fign{accommodates}{Histogram + Boxplot of Accommodates}

In the boxplot we can that there are some outliers. However the distribution of the variable seems to be in line with socioeconomic distributions. The majority of listing have low to medium capacities (small-medium houses), while there's only a fraction of high capacities (big houses). 


\fign{bedrooms}{Histogram + Boxplot of bedrooms}

The majority of listing contains between 1-4 bedrooms, being the mean around 1.6. There are
some outliers, but they can somewhat be explained due to the same reasons mentioned in the accommodates analysis.


\fign{beds}{Histogram + Boxplot of beds}

The distribution of beds and the outliers seem to follow a similar distribution as bedrooms.
This is to be expected as those to variables should be correlated.

\figf{neighbourhood_group_cleansed}{neighbourhood_group_cleansed}

Looking at \ref{\fig:neighbourhood_group_cleansed-pie} we can see that L'Eixample
and Ciutat Vella are the most popular neighborhoods for listing.

\fign{review_scores_location}{Histogram + Boxplot of review scores location}
\fign{review_scores_rating}{Histogram + Boxplot of review scores rating}

We can see that the majority of reviews are considered positive. The mean in fact is 
a 91.07. That would explain why a common technique among renters is to consider 
any review lower than 90 as negative. 

We can see as well that there is some polarization, being the most common rating among 
negative reviews a 0 and the most common among positive a 10. We suppose polarization occurs
because users are more likely to leave reviews when they had either really good or 
really bad experiences.
