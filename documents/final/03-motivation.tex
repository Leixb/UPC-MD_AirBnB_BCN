Airbnb, the world's leading marketplace for booking, discovering, and listing unique spaces around the world, today highlighted a study that details Airbnb's positive economic impact in Barcelona. Conducted in partnership with economists Dwif Consulting and supported by IESE and ESADE-Creafutur Business School, the study found that Airbnb generated $175 million in economic activity in one year in Barcelona and supported 4,310 jobs.
When looking at the number of Airbnb listings, we found out that Barcelona, with 18346 listings in 2019, ranked as the seventh European country. As well as the first among Spanish cities. This suggests that Barcelona is one of the biggest Airbnb markets and therefore and interesting way to explore it's revolutionary business model.
