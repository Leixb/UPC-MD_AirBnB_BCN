\section{Profiling of clusters}%
\label{sec:profiling_of_clusters}

% Profiling of clusters: Use class variable as a response variable to analyze
% conditional distributions of variables to clusters and eventual statistical
% tests to assess which variables are significant in each cluster. Detect
% commonalities of each cluster and differences between clusters. What is
% intrinsic of each cluster? What distinguishes clusters among them?

% Profiling graphs, CPGs, multiple boxplots, bivariate barplots, descriptive by
% groups, etc...

% For selected relevant variables, you can also add specific profiling tests to
% complete clusters interpretation

% Synthesize the result of the classesâ€™ interpretation process into a set of
% templates characterizing the clusters, one template per cluster
