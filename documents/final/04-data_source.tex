created by Inside AirBnb\footnote{Inside Airbnb: \url{http://insideairbnb.com/}},
which aims to present \airbnb data for most major cities all around the globe in
order to provide valuable insight into how \airbnb is being used in each one of them. It 
extracts this data directly from \airbnb's website and the version of the data set
