\section{Data source}%
\label{sec:data_source}

The \airbnb data for Barcelona listings that we use in this project comes from a data
set \cite{dataset} created by Inside AirBnb\footnote{Inside Airbnb: \url{http://insideairbnb.com/}},
which aims to present \airbnb data for most major cities all around the globe in
order to provide valuable insight into how \airbnb is being used in each one of them. It 
extracts this data directly from \airbnb's website and the version of the data set 
we are working with is a snapshot of all Barcelona listings that were available 
on the 24th of August 2020.
