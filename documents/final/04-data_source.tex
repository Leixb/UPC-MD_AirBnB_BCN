\label{sec:data_source}

The \airbnb data for Barcelona listings that we use in this project comes from a data set\footnote{Barcelona listings data set: \url{http://data.insideairbnb.com/spain/catalonia/barcelona/2020-08-24/data/listings.csv.gz}} put together by Inside AirBnb\footnote{Inside Airbnb: \url{http://insideairbnb.com/}}, which aims to provide \airbnb data for most major cities all around the globe. It extracts this data directly from \airbnb's website and the version of the data set we are working with was gathered on the 24th of August 2020.
