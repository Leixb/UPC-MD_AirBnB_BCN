\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:conclusions}

One of the aims of the projects was to explain what variables have an effect on a customer leaving a good or bad review score. After doing the univariate analysis we found out that reviews were pretty polarized.  In fact, most of the scores were pretty high, but there was a small percentage of really bad ones. When analyzing the clusters created by HCPC, it turned out that we accumulated the really bad reviewed listings in cluster 3, while the other three contained mostly excellent scores. This made it hard for us to determine the characteristics of a good review. Despite that we ended up determining the variable profile of badly graded reviews. We concluded that most bad reviews were made to listings of not superhost users, with a limited number of reviews. We also found out that listings of shared rooms where more likely to end up in this cluster.
