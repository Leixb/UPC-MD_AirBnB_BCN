\subsection{Conclusions}
As we can see, we didn't completely follow our plan in terms of timing, some stuff took more than we expected, and other things were easier than we thought, but in the end, we ended up finishing on time to review and prepare for the presentation.
Although we didn't have to make use of the contingency plan, our team was a 4-people team from the 2nd week of the project (because a member of our group changed subjects). This made us need to work harder than a group of 5 or 6 people, but it also made it easier to work together, because there weren't as many opinions, which led to less noise when it came to take a decision.

% TODO
% Critical discussion about deviances of final scheduling with respect to the
% originally designed one and discussion about risks avoided by the initial
% contention plan and unexpected risks appeared during project.
