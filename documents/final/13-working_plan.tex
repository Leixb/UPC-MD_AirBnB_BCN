\subsection{Conclusions}
As we can see, we didn't completely follow our plan in terms of timing, some stuff took more than we expected, and other things were easier than we thought, but in the end, we ended up finishing on time to review and prepare for the presentation.

Although we didn't have to make use of the contingency plan, our team was a 4-people team from the 2nd week of the project (because a member of our group changed subjects). This made us need to work harder than a the average 6-people team, but it also made it easier to work together, because there weren't as many opinions, which led to less noise whenever we had to take a decision. We didn't have many problems doing each data mining process, however our biggest challenge was making the final report and the presentation. In these tasks we would have loved to have an extra hand or two to comment some plots or enhance the presentation further.
