% Formal description of Data structure and metadata

\section{Description of data}%
\label{sec:description_of_data}

The data set has 20,703 entries and 74 variables, out of which 30 are categorical,
38 are numerical and 6 are boolean. These provide information about both the hosts 
and the listings.

Regarding the hosts, it tells us about, among other things, their
names, when they joined \airbnb, where they live, how long they take to respond 
messages, their acceptance and response rates, whether they are superhosts, how 
many listings they have or whether they have a profile picture.

The information it supplies concerning the listings includes its
neighbourhood, its coordinates, the type of property it is, the number of people 
it accommodates, the number of bedrooms, beds and bathrooms, amenities, price, 
the minimum and maximum nights it can be rented, its availability and reviews.

Additionally, the data set contains data that doesn't provide useful information such
as URLs, identifications numbers, names and descriptions or dates.

\subsection{Final scope of study}

After considering what variables were appropriate for our study, we decided to keep 
those shown in the metadata table presented above. We chose these because
we believe they provide real insight into the question we are posing in this study,
in which we aim to find what factors affect most the obtention of positive reviews
and high ratings. 

We discarded the rest
of the variables during preprocessing, either because they were duplicated or
irrelevant. Furthermore, we extrapolated a few variables and created 
two new ones, this process is explained in higher detail in the preprocessing 
section. This resulted in a cleansed data set that contains 30 variables: 
20 numerical, 7 categorical and 4 boolean.
