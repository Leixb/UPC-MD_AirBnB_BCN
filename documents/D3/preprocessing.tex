% Enumerate which steps of the preprocessing process are used with your
% particular data (consider the steps proposed in slide 4 of Preprocessing
% Slides in Theme 2. Data Preparation. Remember that you have the whole
% complete information on preprocessing in the reference text from the
% linkSurvey of preprocessing. Reference paper (MIE 2001) from complementary
% materials section of Theme 2. Data Preparation)

% List and justify all decisions taken for each preprocessing step

% Additional descriptive statistics of variables that have been modified or
% created by preprocessing
