\toprule
Risk & How to prevent & How to manage \\ \midrule
A team member leaves the group & All tasks have at least two members assigned & Pending work reassigned to balance the workload\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
A team member couldn't complete his assigned tasks one week & All tasks have at least two members assigned & Upon being notified that one member can't fulfill his tasks, the members that share tasks with that person will exceptionally complete his tasks for that week.\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
The project (data \& R scripts) is lost or corrupted & Have multiple back up copies of GitHub repository both on the cloud (Overleaf \& GitLab) and locally in our computers & Recover the whole project from one of the other back ups.\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
A member does not have time due to work, an exam or a project & Each member has to make the group aware of busy weeks so the group can schedule the tasks accordingly & If an unexpected time-consuming problem occurs communicate with the group immediately so that work can be redistributed in advance.\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
Conflicting opinions between group members on a specific topic & Stick whenever possible to what we agreed on the preliminary plan & If there are conflicting opinions in a specific decision let each member explain his point of view. After that vote and proceed with the majority opinion.\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
We get inconclusive or conflicting results in some step & Try to finish each step days before delivery day so there is time to solve the problem & As the project requires progressive work, solve the problem in this each before starting the next one. If the problem can't be pinpointed communicate with our lab teacher.  
\\
\addlinespace[0.5em]
The Government imposes a quarantine and we aren't allowed to do face-to-face classes or meetings & There's nothing in our hands to prevent this & Set up a Slack to coordinate the work and a Discord group to do online group meetings.\\
